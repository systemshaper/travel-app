# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project primarily demonstrates my ability to manage asynchronous api calls

## Getting Started
Enter the name of a location, and the date that you will leave to visit that location. The app will call a selection of apis to return information relevant to that trip, including an image (if found) and weather data, as well as a handy countdown to remind you how many days you have to prepare for your trip. You can add multiple trips, or remove a trip, and see the full list sorted by date.

## Dependencies
In addition to the "standard" dependencies included in all recent Udacity FEND projects, I've added the "uuid" plugin in order to generate unique identifiers for my dynamically created html.
